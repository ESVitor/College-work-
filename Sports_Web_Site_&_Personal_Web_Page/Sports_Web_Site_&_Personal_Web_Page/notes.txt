Where do we begin with the history of sports? When the history of sports is as old as humankind. To begin with what has been recorded or documented in the history of sports, takes us back at least 3,000 years. The early history of sports often involved the preparation and training for war or hunting. Hence there were sports games that involved the throwing of spears, stakes, and rocks, and of course lots of play-fighting.

According to historical records, the first ancient Olympic Games can be traced back to 776 BC. They were dedicated to the Olympian gods and were staged on the ancient plains of Olympia. They continued for nearly 12 centuries, until Emperor Theodosius decreed in 393 A.D. that all such "pagan cults" be banned.

On 6 April 1896, Easter Monday, the streets of Athens were even more animated than usual. All of the public buildings were draped in bunting, while multi-coloured streamers floated in the wind and green wreaths decked many of the house fronts. Everywhere one looked, one saw the letters “0. A.” (the Greek initials of the Olympic Games) and the dates “BC 776, AD 1896”, indicating the first year of the ancient Games and the first year of their modern reincarnation.

Sport and Health

In 2002 the World Health Organisation (WHO) World Health Report indicated that mortality, morbidity and disability attributed to the major non-communicable diseases accounted for over 60% of all deaths, and unhealthy diets and physical inactivity were among the leading causes of these diseases.
Sport and physical activity are crucial for life-long healthy living. Sport and play improve health and well-being, extend life expectancy and reduce the likelihood of several non-communicable diseases including heart disease.

Regular physical activity and play are essential for physical, mental, psychological and social development. Good habits start early: The important role of physical education is demonstrated by the fact that children who exercise are more likely to stay physically active as adults. Sport also plays a major positive role in one’s emotional health, and allows to build valuable social connections, often offering opportunities for play and self-expression.

Recognizing the important links between sport, physical activity and health, in 2004 the WHO adopted the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health and a Resolution Health Promotion and Healthy lifestyles. Both documents emphasize the importance to start the practice of adapted physical activity early in childhood.
